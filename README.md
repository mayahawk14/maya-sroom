Hello! Welcome to my room!

This is a personal project I developed to try my hand at web development and design. Through this, I've been able to teach myself html, css, and am working on my javascript skills as we speak!
Feel free to wander my room for a bit. I'm always changing and updating it, so it will never quite be done. Thanks for checking it out!
