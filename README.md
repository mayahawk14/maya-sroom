# Hello! Welcome to my room!

This is a personal project I developed to try my hand at web development and design. Through this, I've been able to teach myself html, css, and am working on my javascript skills as we speak!
Feel free to wander my room for a bit. I'm always changing and updating it, so it will never quite be done. Thanks for checking it out!

### Couple notes:
- If the first page looks stupid, that's because that is what my real desktop (roughly) looks like. I thought it would be funny but looking at it every once in a while is an eyesore. Either way, that's the point.
